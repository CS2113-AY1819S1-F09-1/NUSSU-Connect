== Overview

The purpose of this portfolio is to document a summary of my contributions to the project. This project is a software
engineering project that aims to solve some of the common issues that NUSSU is facing.
NUSSU-Connect is an application for executive committee (exco) members of the NUS Student Union (NUSSU) to help them perform their daily tasks including managing recruitment, contacts, budgets and projects efficiently.
Other team members working on this project are Jonathan Ng Hian Leong, Sanjukta, and Soh Boon Jun.

== Summary of contributions

== Preface
This section shows the various contributions made to the project, covering aspects such as enhancement features, codes contributed and other forms of contributions.

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to securely log into the application with the relevant login credentials with a specific level of access to the application features associated with the login credentials*
** What it does: allows the user to undo all previous commands one at a time. Preceding undo commands can be reversed by using the redo command.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can make mistakes in commands and the app should provide a convenient way to rectify them.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.
** Credits: _{mention here if you reused any code/ideas from elsewhere or if a third-party library is heavily used in the feature so that a reader can make a more accurate judgement of how much effort went into the feature}_

* *Minor enhancement*: added a history command that allows the user to navigate to previous commands using up/down keys.

* *Code contributed*: [https://github.com[Functional code]] [https://github.com[Test code]] _{give links to collated code files}_

* *Other contributions*:

** Project management:
*** Managed releases `v1.3` - `v1.5rc` (3 releases) on GitHub
** Enhancements to existing features:
*** Updated the GUI color scheme (Pull requests https://github.com[#33], https://github.com[#34])
*** Wrote additional tests for existing features to increase coverage from 88% to 92% (Pull requests https://github.com[#36], https://github.com[#38])
** Documentation:
*** Did cosmetic tweaks to existing contents of the User Guide: https://github.com[#14]
** Community:

*** Contributed to forum discussions (examples:  https://github.com[1], https://github.com[2], https://github.com[3], https://github.com[4])
*** Reported bugs and suggestions for other teams in the class (examples:  https://github.com[1], https://github.com[2], https://github.com[3])
*** Some parts of the history feature I added was adopted by several other class mates (https://github.com[1], https://github.com[2])
** Tools:
*** Integrated a third party library (Natty) to the project (https://github.com[#42])
*** Integrated a new Github plugin (CircleCI) to the team repo
