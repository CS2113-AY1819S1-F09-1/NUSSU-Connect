== PROJECT: NUSSU Connect


== Introduction and Overview
This Portfolio is a documentation of the contributions that I have made during the development of this application, named
*NUSSU Connect*. It is a CLI application developed by team https://cs2113-ay1819s1-f09-1.github.io/main/AboutUs.html[F09-1] and
it mainly caters to executive committee members of the NUS Student Union (NUSSU).

Being a part of many projects and initiatives, this application aims to let the exco members manage their
budgets, expenses, human resource allocation and contacts with an additional security guarantee so that they could complete their tasks with high efficiency.

== Summary of contributions

In this project, my main contribution is in the Search Pruning feature and the main purpose of this feature is to
ease the process of managing a large list of contacts.
Further details about my contributions will be explained in this section.

* *Major enhancement*: Added the ability to prune the list of contacts by keeping a record of Search History.

** What it does: Each subsequent execution of `find` commands allows users to search and reduce the size
of the current displayed list of contacts. `undofind` command does the opposite and reverts the last `find`
command executed.

** Justification: NUSSU exco is an organization that will most likely be required to keep track of
a large list of important contacts. Therefore it will be time-consuming to locate one/a specific group of contact information from the list.
Hence, a search pruning feature allows the users to narrow the search space in discrete steps and help them
retrieve the relevant contact information much more efficiently.

** Highlights: This enhancement is mainly created from scratch with some help from documentations on how the `Predicate` class works.
This enhancement was also created with re-usability in mind and any form of filtering done with `Predicate` will be able to
utilize this feature.

* *Minor enhancement*: Added the feature that allows users to see a history of keywords they used in their search when utilizing the Search Pruning feature.

** What it does: Every time a user performs a search, the command result box will display the list of keywords describing how the current displayed list is being filtered.

* *Minor enhancement*: Improved find command by introducing searching by tags and exclude functionality

** What it does: Searching by tags allows users to filter the contacts according to the tagged description of each contact. Exclude functionality allows users to remove
unwanted results from their search.
