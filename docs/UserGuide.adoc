== Introduction

NUSSU-Connect is an application designed and created specifically for executive committee (exco) members of the NUS Student Union (NUSSU). It enables you, as a committee member, to reduce your daily workload and your organisation to potentially minimize manpower and logistics issues during peak periods of activity by providing them a convenient platform to manage recruitment, contacts, budgets and projects efficiently. The application can also be used by every organisation with a clearly defined hierarchy of roles and responsibilities of each and every member belonging to the organisation.
The aim of this application is to digitise any company’s or organisation’s standard operating procedures, through the process of streamlining workflow to essentially solve, or at least minimize, any manpower and logistics issues that can happen during any peak periods of business activities.

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `NUSSU-Connect.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your NUSSU-Connect.
.  Double-click on the jar file to start the app and wait for a few seconds for the loading to complete. You will then see a login pop up window appears as shown in the image below. You will need to head over to section 3.1, "Logging into system" and follow the steps detailed carefully in order to log into the application successfully.
+

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all contacts
* **`createaccount`**`A1234568M zaq1xsw2cde3 member` : creates a new account with `A1234568M` as the user id, `zaq1xsw2cde3` as the user password, and `member` as the user role of the account to be created.
* **`add`**`n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : adds a contact named `John Doe` to NUSSU-Connect.
* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  You can refer to Section 3, <<Features>> subsection to see more detailed documentation of the features that are built in this application.

[NOTE]
====
User Id, Password and Role inputs are all case-sensitive!
====

[NOTE]
====
If you attempt to minimize the application before logging in to do other things, only to come back to the application later, and you want to close the application, you should not click on the cross button on the top right hand corner of the application, as shown in the image below. It is not recommended to close the application as shown in the image below, as this would cause the application to become unresponsive. You should switch windows repeatedly with the Alt + Tab keys on your keyboard until you can see the login dialog box shown in the image below. Once that is done, you can then safely click on the cross button found on the top right hand corner of the dialog box, circled in red, to close the application.

// tag::searchpruningtitle[]
=== Search Pruning Feature with list, find and undofind commands
// end::searchpruningtitle[]

// tag::searchpruningpreface[]
Since v1.1, the Search Pruning feature was introduced to NUSSU Connect that helps you
trim the list of contacts with every successive find command. This lets you search through the list
of contacts in a much more intuitive manner without the hassle of typing a long single line command that is
usually error-prone.

The concept of the Search Pruning feature will be illustrated below. +
// end::searchpruningpreface[]

// tag::searchpruningguide[]
**1. Search Pruning with Find Commands**

****
Assume that the original list of contacts contains the following six persons and you wanted to search for all persons
with the science tag. You could do this by executing the command `find \tag science`. +

image::SearchPruning1st.png[align="left", width = 200]

After executing the command the displayed list will now contain 2 persons,
both with the science tag.

image::SearchPruning2nd.png[align="left", width = 200]

The following message will be displayed in the Command Result Box to tell you the keywords that you have previously executed.
The "+" prefix before a keyword is used to denote that you chose to include all persons with the relevant keyword in
the displayed list. +

image::SearchPruning3rd.png[align="left", width = 350]

Next, you wanted to exclude everyone that has the tag `VPresident` and you could do that by executing the command +
`find \tag \exclude VPresident`. +

image::SearchPruning4th.png[align="left", width = 200]

The command will filter according to the previous displayed list instead of the original contacts list and the
displayed list now contains only 1 person with the President Tag as everyone with the VPresident tag have been excluded. +

image::SearchPruning5th.png[align="left", width = 200]

The Command Result Box will now display an extra vpresident keyword with the "-" prefix, denoting that all persons
with the vpresident tag has been excluded from the list +

image::SearchPruning6th.png[align="left", width = 350]
****

**2 . Making a mistake and undoing it with undofind command**

****
Now assume that you have made a mistake and you want to revert to the list before you execute your most
recent find command. You can do so with the undofind command +

image::SearchPruning7th.png[align="left", width = 200]

After executing the undofind command, the displayed list is reverted to the state before the +
`find \tag \exclude VPresident` command was executed +

image::SearchPruning8th.png[align="left", width = 200]
****

// end::searchpruningguide[]

**3 . Reverting to initial state with list command**

****
You can revert to the initial state before any find commands are executed with the list command

image::SearchPruning9th.png[align="left", width = 200]

After executing the list command, all search history is cleared and the displayed list now contains all six persons.

image::SearchPruning10th.png[align="left", width = 200]
****

// end::find[]

=== Deleting : `delete`

Deletes a specific person from NUSSU-Connect. +
Format: `delete [INDEX]`

****
* Deletes the person at the specified `INDEX`.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed person list.
* The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
* delete -a will delete all contacts in the displayed list (to be released in v2.0)
****

Examples:

* `list` +
`delete 2` +
Deletes the 2nd person in NUSSU-Connect.
* `find Betsy` +
`delete 1` +
Deletes the 1st person in the results of the `find` command.

=== Selecting a person : `select`

Selects the person identified by the index number used in the displayed person list. +
Format: `select INDEX`

****
* Selects the person and loads the Google search page the person at the specified `INDEX`.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed person list.
* The index *must be a positive integer* `1, 2, 3, ...`
****

Examples:

* `list` +
`select 2` +
Selects the 2nd person in NUSSU-Connect.
* `find Betsy` +
`select 1` +
Selects the 1st person in the results of the `find` command.

=== Listing entered commands : `history`

Lists all the commands that you have entered in reverse chronological order. +
Format: `history`

[NOTE]
====
Pressing the kbd:[&uarr;] and kbd:[&darr;] arrows will display the previous and next input respectively in the command box.
====

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undoing previous command : `undo`

Restores NUSSU-Connect to the state before the previous _undoable_ command was executed. +
Format: `undo`

[NOTE]
====
Undoable commands: those commands that modify NUSSU-Connect's content (`add`, `delete`, `edit` and `clear`).
====

Examples:

* `delete 1` +
`list` +
`undo` (reverses the `delete 1` command) +

* `select 1` +
`list` +
`undo` +
The `undo` command fails as there are no undoable commands executed previously.

* `delete 1` +
`clear` +
`undo` (reverses the `clear` command) +
`undo` (reverses the `delete 1` command) +

=== Redoing the previously undone command : `redo`

Reverses the most recent `undo` command. +
Format: `redo`

Examples:

* `delete 1` +
`undo` (reverses the `delete 1` command) +
`redo` (reapplies the `delete 1` command) +

* `delete 1` +
`redo` +
The `redo` command fails as there are no `undo` commands executed previously.

* `delete 1` +
`clear` +
`undo` (reverses the `clear` command) +
`undo` (reverses the `delete 1` command) +
`redo` (reapplies the `delete 1` command) +
`redo` (reapplies the `clear` command) +
// end::undoredo[]

=== Clearing all entries : `clear`

Clears all entries from NUSSU-Connect. +
Format: `clear`

// tag::budget[]

=== Budgeting feature: `budget`, `calculatebudget` and `viewbudget`

The budgeting process has 3 steps and involves club members and NUSSU treasurers as the users in the different steps

Step 1: Submitting the data for budget allocation which is to be done by *club members*. +

Step 2: Calculating the budgets to be allocated which is to be done by *NUSSU treasurers*. +

Step 3: Viewing the allocated budget of a club which can be done by either *club members* or *NUSSU treasurers*.

==== Submitting data for budget allocation: `budget`
This is the first step in the budgeting process!

This command allows club members to submit budget calculation data - the name of their club, number of events the club is planning to hold and the expected turnout of the events  +
Format: `budget c/CLUB NAME t/EXPECTED TURNOUT e/NUMBER OF EVENTS`

Example: +
`budget c/Computing Club t/200 e/5`

[NOTE]
====
CLUB NAME is case sensitive. Hence `c/Computing Club` and `c/computing club` will be treated as unique entries.
====

[NOTE]
====
EXPECTED TURNOUT and NUMBER OF EVENTS must be postive whole numbers.
====

==== Calculating the budgets : `calculatebudget`
This is the second step in the budgeting process!

After all the clubs' budget calculation data has been submitted by the club members, NUSSU treasurers must use this command to calculate and allocate budgets to all the clubs based on the total available budget +
Format: `calculatebudget b/TOTAL AVAILABLE BUDGET IN SGD`

Example: +
`calculatebudget b/50000`

[NOTE]
====
Ensure that TOTAL AVAILABLE BUDGET is a positive whole number, i.e. it can also be zero.
====

[NOTE]
====
Remember to only use the `calculatebudget` command once ALL the clubs' data has been collected since NUSSU-Connect only supports a one-time calculation of budgets in v1.4
====

==== Viewing the allocated budget for a club : `viewbudget`
This is the third and final step in the budgeting process!

This command shows the budget allocated to that particular club to the user. Both club members and NUSSU treasurers have access to this command.
Format: `viewbudget c/CLUB NAME`

Example: +
`viewbudget c/Computing Club`

// end::budget[]

=== Exiting the program : `exit`

Exits the program. +
Format: `exit`

=== Saving the data

NUSSU-Connect data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. +
There is no need to save manually.

// tag::dataencryption[]
=== Encrypting data files `[coming in v2.0]`

_{explain how the user can enable/disable data encryption}_
// end::dataencryption[]

== FAQ

*Q*: How do I transfer my data to another Computer? +
*A*: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous NUSSU-Connect folder.

== Command Summary
