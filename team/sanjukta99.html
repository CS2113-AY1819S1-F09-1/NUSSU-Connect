<p>This Portfolio is a documentation of the contributions that I have made for this project, titled NUSSU-Connect.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>NUSSU-Connect is a resource management application targeting the members of the NUS Student Union (NUSSU). This application aims to simplify the tedious and time consuming management duties that an average club carries out. Hence the functions of our app are :
<strong>Storing</strong> the details about every member of the NUSSU, facilitating a comprehensive <strong>search</strong> feature and <strong>financial logistics management</strong>, integrated in a platform that supports <strong>multi-level user access</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>NUSSU-Connect aims to be an <strong>Efficient</strong>, <strong>Intuitive</strong> and most of all <strong>Secure</strong> application.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The original source code of this project is the <a href="https://github.com/se-edu/">AddressBook-Level4</a> project created by SE-EDU initiative, and hence,
it also comes with some features from the AB4 project.</p>

<p>My main contribution to this project is the Budgeting Feature. The intended purpose of this feature is to help the NUSSU treasurers allocate budgets fairly and equitably to all the clubs under the NUSSU based on the budget calculation data collected from the clubs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The main aim of the budgeting feature is to boost the efficiency of one aspect of financial logistics management. Hence, the feature was designed keeping in mind <strong>ease of use</strong> for the users, and is an attempt to <strong>speed up</strong> one of the more tedious management duties performed by clubs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I will further elaborate on my contributions in the following sections.</p>

<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>What it does: Allows the members of clubs to submit the data - the number of events that the club is planning to hold and the expected turnout of each of these events - for the calculation of their club&#8217;s budget using the <code>budget</code> command. Once data from all of the clubs has been collected NUSSU treasurers can use the <code>calculatebudget</code> command to calculate and allocate a fair and equitable budget for each of the clubs based on the total available budget.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Justification: Managing finances is one of the most important and time consuming functions of an organization. The budgeting feature implemented in NUSSU-Connect is a simple and less tedious alternative to the present budget allocation system in place in the NUSSU.
This feature helps its users save on precious time, which can now be spent on other tasks which require their attention.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Highlights: The <code>calculatebudget</code> command was created almost entirely from scratch. The algorithm used to equitably calculate budgets is entirely my design.</p>

<p>What it does: Using the <code>viewbudget</code> command, club members and NUSSU treasurers can enter the name of a club and view its budget.</p>
</li>

<h4 id="current-implementation"><a class="link" href="#current-implementation">Current Implementation</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This feature has been implemented through 3 separate commands, each dealing with a separate stage in the calculation and
subsequent allocation of budgets by the NUSSU Executive Committee to all the clubs that submit the data required to
calculate the budget. The three commands are: <code>budget</code> - which handles the submission of data by the club treasurer required to
calculate the budget for that club, <code>calculatebudget</code> - which is to be used only by the NUSSU Executive Committee members
in order to calculate the budgets for each club and <code>viewbudget</code> - which lists the final budgets of all the clubs.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="submission-of-data"><a class="link" href="#submission-of-data">Submission of Data</a></h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Given below is an example usage scenario and the behaviour at each step of the <code>budget</code> command.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. 'filteredClubsList' will be initialised with an empty list
of all the clubs' budget calculation data in the address book. Similarly 'filteredClubBudgets' will be initialised with an empty list of all the club budgets in the address book.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step 2. The user (a club member) executes <code>budget c/Computing Club t/200 e/5</code> command in order to submit the data for the calculation of her club&#8217;s budget. The 'LogicManager' then calls the 'parseCommand' in the
'AddressBookParser'.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step 3. The 'AddressBookParser' then returns a new 'BudgetCommandParser', if the user is of the <strong>member</strong> role. (Else a parse exception is thrown.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step 4. The 'BudgetCommandParser' parses the command to be executed and creates a 'ClubBudgetElements' object called 'club' with the club&#8217;s name, the expected turnout and the number of events, as specified by the user. Finally the 'BudgetCommand' is called with 'club' as the argument.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step 5. The 'BudgetCommand' checks whether the 'club' is a duplicate and if it is not, the 'BudgetCommand' calls the 'addClub' method in 'Model' with 'club' as the argument.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step 6. 'Model' calls 'addClub' in 'ReadOnlyClubBudgetElementsBook' and indicates that the club budget elements book&#8217;s status has changed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step 7. 'ReadOnlyClubBudgetElementsBook' calls the 'addClub' command on an object 'clubs' of the 'UniqueClubsList' class, thus
adding the required club&#8217;s data to the club budget elements book.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step 8. Finally a success message is displayed with the details that have been entered by the user.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonitionblock note">
<table>
<tr>
<td class="icon">
<i class="fa icon-note" title="Note"></i>
</td>
<td class="content">
As mentioned in Step 5, had the user entered a club name that already existed in the list of clubs in the address book, then a duplicate club budget elements message would be shown, prompting the user to edit their entered command and try again. Execution of subsequent steps would be stopped until the
user entered a unique club name.

<p>Given below is an example usage scenario and the behaviour at each step of the <code>calculatebudget</code> command.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step 1. 'filteredClubsList' will no longer be an empty list, and will now contain the budget calculation data of the clubs that have been added using the <code>budget</code> command.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step 2. The user (a NUSSU treasurer) executes the <code>calculatebudget b/50000</code> command with '50000' as the total available budget, in order to calulate and allocate all the clubs' budgets. The 'LogicManager' then calls the 'parseCommand' in the
'AddressBookParser'.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step 3. The 'AddressBookParser' then returns a new 'BudgetCalculationCommandParser', if the user is of the role <strong>treasurer</strong>. (Else a parse exception is thrown.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step 4.'BudgetCalculationCommandParser' parses the command and creates a 'TotalBudget' object called 'totalBudget' with the total available budget specified by the user. Finally the 'BudgetCalculationCommand' is called with 'totalBudget' as the argument.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step 5. The 'BudgetCalculationCommand' checks whether the 'totalBudget' is a negative number. It also checks whether the budgets have already been calculated before using the getHaveBudgetsBeenCalculated method of the 'BudgetCalculationManager'. It also checks whether the clubBudgetElementsBook is empty. If none of this are true, then the 'filteredClubsList' is iterated through to calculate the budget, an object 'toAdd' of the 'FinalClubBudget' class, of each club in the list. When the budget for a club has been calculated, the 'BudgetCalculationCommand' calls the 'addClubBudget' method in Model with 'toAdd' as the parameter.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step 6. 'Model' calls 'addClubBudget' in 'ReadOnlyFinalBudgetBook' and indicates that the finalBudgetsBook&#8217;s status has changed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step 7. 'ReadOnlyFinalBudgetBook' calls the 'addClubBudget' command on an object 'clubBudgets' of the 'UniqueClubBudgetsList' class, thus adding the required club&#8217;s allocated budget to the finalClubBudgetsBook. The process repeats until the budget for every club in the 'filteredClubsList' has been calculated and allocated.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step 8. Once the budget for every club has been allocated a success message is displayed, telling the user that the budgets have been calculated.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step 2. The user (a NUSSU treasurer, a club member or even a club&#8217;s President) executes the <code>viewbudget c/Computing Club</code> command to view the budget allocated to the club that she has specified (in this case the Computing Club). The 'LogicManager' then calls the 'AddressBookParser'.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step 3. The 'AddressBookParser' then returns a new ViewClubBudgetsCommandParser' if the user role is set to either <strong>member</strong>, <strong>treasurer</strong> or <strong>president</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step 4. The 'ViewClubBudgetsCommandParser' then creates a 'ClubName' object called clubName. Finally the 'ViewClubBudgetsCommand' is called with 'clubName' as the argument.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step 5. 'ViewClubBudgetsCommand' checks whether the budgets have been calculated already. If they have not, an error message is shown to the user. If they have, then the 'filteredClubBudgetsList' is looped through to find a 'FinalClubBudget' object with the same 'ClubName' as the 'clubName' that is specified by the user (in this case 'Computing Club'). If it is found, then the associated 'allocatedBudget' of that 'FinalClubBudget' object is displayed to the user. Else a message saying that the specified club&#8217;s budget does not exist is shown to the user.</p>

<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pros: Faster and takes less storage space</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cons: Less intuitive or readable since items are presented in a manner that is more similar to the code.</p>

<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Alternative 1 (current choice):</strong> Currently the final club budgets are stored in a list (which is accessed when using the <code>viewbudget</code> command).</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pros: Easier to implement, with respect to the project&#8217;s time constraints</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cons: Not a good choice with respect to time complexity. If the list of final club budgets is very large, then looping through it in worst case time complexity of O(N) to find the desired club&#8217;s budget, is very slow. Thus not allowing the NFR of speed to be achieved.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Alternative 2:</strong> Using a map to store the final club budgets</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pros: Far faster to search for the desired club&#8217;s final budget given that Club Names must be unique.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cons: Would take longer to implement.</p>

<h4 id="possible-extensions"><a class="link" href="#possible-extensions">Possible Extensions</a></h4>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Implementing an <code>editbudget</code> command to allow the club members to edit the budget calculation data until the treasurers have calculated and allocated the budgets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allowing the NUSSU treasurers to calculate and allocate the budgets multiple times. This will allow them to change the total budget as and when needed and also allow club members to keep submitting their budget calculation data.</p>
